# Logistic_app_Demo
 
This is a personal project to help remember some principles of Python. Not the largest thing I could think of but will give me plenty of stuff to learn on the way!

It's a general logistics app. It's general purpose is to do something of everything one could require in the shipment enviroment. It's not specialised or secure in any way, all the data is stored in .TXT files that can be easily accessed and I don't plan on adding any security, do not use this for anything other than your own fun

# About the program.
## What features does it have now?
Not too many. You can create a new user and load it into the program. 

### What stuff is actively being developed?
There's plenty of stuff I don't know that might be required so this list contains the general Ideas that are being developed but not the details of each thing.

- Manifest generator: It'll generate Shipment and Cargo manifests that are very barebones
- User Editing: I want to be able to edit a created user without the need to save the file through a file dialog, just the press of a button
- Buttons... A truckload of buttons. I don't know what They'll do yet, but buttons...

### Planned Features?
Not much is "planned" here, most of it is a spur of the moment thing but I do have some stuff I want to work on.

- The ability for the User ID generator to remember what was the last generated ID even after the program has closed.
